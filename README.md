# marvelApi
The project consists of **two pages**: a main page with _all the marvel caracters_ and a page with your _favorite ones_.
On the main page you can see cards with 33 marvel caracters, you can use **button LOAD MORE** to load more marvel caracters.
You can _ADD_ any caracter to your favorites and _DELETE_ any of them from favorites. I used **local storage** to make this functionality.
