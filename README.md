# marvelApi
The project consists of two pages: a main page with all the marvel caracters and a page with your favorite ones.
On the main page you can see cards with 33 marvel caracters, you can use button LOAD MORE to load more marvel caracters.
You can ADD any caracter to your favorites and DELETE any of them from favorites. I used local storage to make this functionality.
